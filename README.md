# 🫀 Heart Disease Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses real-world healthcare data to predict heart disease risk using supervised machine learning. It simulates a clinical decision support system focusing on medical diagnostic metrics like **recall** and **ROC-AUC** for responsible AI.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Based on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**
- Emphasizes medical metrics: Recall, ROC-AUC, and F1-score
- Includes:
  - Data Preprocessing
  - Domain-Aware Feature Engineering
  - Model Selection & Evaluation
  - Interpretability for Responsible AI

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: 81.3%
- **Precision**: 71.4%
- **Recall**: 65.8%
- **F1 Score**: 68.5%
- **ROC-AUC**: 87.1%

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
